# SQL & Python Project Practice

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a hands-on practice exercise focused on analyzing and managing database tables using both SQL queries and Python code. It explores how to work with single and multiple tables, perform data manipulation, and integrate SQL logic into Python workflows.

The project was developed using **Jupyter Notebooks** with **SQL Magic** for interactive querying, and clean, modular Python code in **Visual Studio**. Key libraries used include:

- `pandas` for data analysis and manipulation
- `sqlite3` for database connectivity and execution

---

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Practice writing efficient SQL queries for real-world datasets
- Explore multi-table joins and conditional filtering
- Integrate SQL logic into Python scripts for dynamic analysis
- Use Jupyter for exploratory work and Visual Studio for production-ready code
